.\README.md,"Codon is a high-performance Python compiler that compiles Python code to native machine code without any runtime overhead. Typical speedups over Python are on the order of 100x or more, on a single thread. Codon supports native multithreading which can lead to speedups many times higher still."
.\README.md,"The Codon framework is fully modular and extensible, allowing for the seamless integration of new modules, compiler optimizations, domain-specific languages and so on. We actively develop Codon extensions for a number of domains such as bioinformatics and quantitative finance."
